Although the family that was picture on our home page has yet to be found.  Some say that Pat chopped them up and baked them into his cookies. Is that the secret ingredient? Who knows!</p>

                            <p class="cityWriteUp">Pat was on a summer cruise in the spring of 2006.  He disembarked in Tokyo and partied so hard that he knew he had to open a location there.  He proceeded to get drunk in all the famous locations and even puked at the Sensoji Temple.  But while he is in town,  you can catch him at cosplay go-karting - playing drinking rules. </p>

He started selling out of them within the first hour of opening.  With sales so great, he invented the first que bar.  Get drunk while in line! I guess those in Dubai really know how to party.  </p>

Learning all the new fancy smoking techniques in France, he incorporated this into his recipe.  Do the cupcakes contain nicotine, oils, carcinogins? Only Pat knows.  Come bring Pat your perferred ingredient and he'll whip you something up.</p>

Its may have something to do with the brothel that is hidden in the basement.  But you can not access that without answering one of Pat's riddles.
