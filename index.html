                    <h3>The idea that became a reality...</h3>
                    <p id="colorText"> Fed up one day with his job in the corporate world, Pat went out fishing.  He took a 6 pack and a pre-rolled with him to forget all the negativity for the day.  And so he went, getting drunk and high catching his favorite fish, salmon. After hours of relaxing, he got hungry.  He thought, "Hey man, you know what would be amazing?... Salmon cookies! Hell Yea! ~ Just mix my two favorite foods and BAM, friggin' weird and awesome!"<br><br>And so Pat thought his brilliant stoner idea would land him millions.  He quit his job the next day and opened up his first store in Seattle.  Pat's now has stores internationally and he makes sure to party in every location.  </p>

                    <h2> Pat, the family man...</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Pat was a young man, he wanted nothing more than to party. This family to the left is fake, actually the people are real.  They were the first taste-testers of the original salmon cookies.  Unfortunately for them, they caught salmonella (go figure) and died.   He leaves this photo up as a reminder, at first you don't succeed - Keep on trying!"
                    </p>
                    <p>Pat can be seen most days at a bar near one of his many locations.  If you see him around, buy him a drink - he will give you a coupon for a free dozen of his salmon cookies.  If you tell him a joke when you come in, he will give you a lap dance in return.  See, all Pat wants to do is party! That and make you some damn good salmon cookies!
