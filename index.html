                    <h3>The idea that became a reality...</h3>
                    <p id="colorText">   Fed up one day with his job in the corporate world, Pat went out fishing.  He took a 6 pack and a pre-rolled with him to forget all the negativity for the day.  And so he went, getting drunk and high catching his favorite fish, salmon. After hours of relaxing, he got hungry and all he had was his caught salmon.  He thought, "Man, you know what would be amazing?... Salmon cookies! Hell Yea!"<br><br>And so Pat thought his brilliant stoner idea would land him millions.  He quit his job the next day and opened up his first store in Seattle.  Pat's now has stores internationally and he makes sure to party in every location.  </p>

                    <h2> Pat, the family man...</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Pat was a young man, he wanted nothing more than to party. This family to the left is fake, actually the people are real.  They were the first taste-testers of the original salmon cookies.  Unfortunately for them, they caught salmonella (go figure) and died.   He leaves this photo up to a reminder to all those that want to try salmon cookies, "you crazy!"
                    </p>
                    <p>Pat can be seen most days at a bar near one of his many locations.  If you see him around, buy him a drink - he will give you a coupon for a free dozen of his salmon cookies.
